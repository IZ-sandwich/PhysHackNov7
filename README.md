# McGill Physics Hackathon (2020) - Mathematical Modeling of Animal Patterns

This is our entry for the McGill Physics Hackathon (2020). We built a numerical model to generate patterns commonly seen on animals, fish and flora. Our approach uses a reaction-diffusion model orininally proposed by Alan Turin in 1952. We focued mainly on the Gray-Scott model and produced a bunch of graphics which can be seen in the 'output' folder.
