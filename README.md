# PhysHackNov7 - Mathematical Modeling of Animal Patterns

We built a numerical to generate patterns commonly seen on animals, fish and flora. Our approach uses a reaction-diffusion model orininally proposed by Alan Turin in 1952. We focued mainly on the Gray-Scott model and produced a bunch of graphics which can be seen in the 'output' folder.
